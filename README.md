# Healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis
Detecting fraud in medicare claims
Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:

a) Billing for services that were not provided.

b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.

c) Misrepresenting the service provided.

d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.

e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered.

The goal is to:
- Predict the potentially fraudulent providers
- Discover important variables helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraudulent providers
- Study fraudulent patterns in the provider's claim
